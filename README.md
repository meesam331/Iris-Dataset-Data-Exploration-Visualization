Loaded the Iris dataset using sns.load_dataset()

Checked data shape, column names, and first rows using .head()

Explored dataset structure using .info() and .describe()

Created visualizations:

Scatter plots to show relationships between features

Histograms for distribution

Box plots to identify outliers
